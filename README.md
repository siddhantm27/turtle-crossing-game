# turtle-crossing-game
## This project is a part of the "100 Days of Code" course by Angela Yu
Created in python turtle graphics with progressively harder levels.\
Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the turtle and help it cross the road to the other side, without letting any of the cars hit it.
